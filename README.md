#Advanced-Programming
Advanced C++ Learning Repository

This repository contains a collection of C++ programs developed while exploring more advanced topics and programming concepts. The code goes beyond the basics to demonstrate practical applications of algorithms, memory management, object-oriented design, and data structures.

Overview

Each file focuses on a specific concept or technique, showcasing how core C++ features interact in more complex scenarios. The repository serves as both a continuation of fundamental studies and a reference for intermediate to advanced programming practices.

Topics Covered

Sorting Algorithms – implementation and comparison of various sorting methods

Function Parameters and Memory Allocation – stack vs. heap behavior and parameter passing techniques

Pointers and Memory Management – manual allocation, deallocation, and avoiding memory leaks

Object-Oriented Programming – implementation of regular and pure virtual functions for polymorphism

Recursion – solving problems through self-referential function calls

Stacks and Data Structures – basic implementation and usage of stack operations

Project Example: Card Game – a small application combining multiple concepts such as classes, dynamic memory, and logic flow

Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to consolidate the study of intermediate and advanced C++ programming techniques through practical examples. It is intended as a reference for reinforcing understanding of core computational concepts, algorithmic design, and efficient memory handling.
